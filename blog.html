	        <p>Well the time has come that I finally responded to those two requests for a blog. I suppose my daily rants on my finsta were just not enough. But fear not! I never back down from a challenge, and this will be quite fun for me anyway. Not to mention that this is not my first experience with blogging. To this day, all Analog Devices employees are fully capable of cringing at my bad jokes on the blog I started for the robotics interns last year. I was even recognized in the hall once for it. The fame did not, however, go to my head, and though I only do autographs by special requests now to try to mitigate the onslaught of my millions of adoring fans, this blog will be 100% authentic Emily Satterfield. On occasion, this will mean I will go on swirling tangents amidst an existential crisis, but it will also include reflections on daily life, how I handle being a hot mess, my adventures to far away lands, and maybe even some recipes if I am feeling inspired. The first few posts I write will be based on prompts that were provided in an application to be an MIT blogger. If, by chance, the person who is evaluating that application is reading this right now, you look lovely today:) Just kidding. But in all seriousness, I truly do want to tell my story on the MIT admissions blog too, so hopefully that works out. </p>
            <p>I wanted to come up with a more clever way to write my first ever blog post - perhaps a pun in the title, or a fun little anecdote - but if I’m telling the truth I have been sitting in my cubicle for about 4 hours now, and the tan walls and silence didn’t really bring me any inspiration. A picture of my dogs will have to suffice.
