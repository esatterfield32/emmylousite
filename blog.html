	    <h3> An introduction</h3>

	        <p>Well the time has come that I finally responded to those two requests for a blog. I suppose my daily rants on my finsta were just not enough. But fear not! I never back down from a challenge, and this will be quite fun for me anyway. Not to mention that this is not my first experience with blogging. To this day, all Analog Devices employees are fully capable of cringing at my bad jokes on the blog I started for the robotics interns last year. I was even recognized in the hall once for it. The fame did not, however, go to my head, and though I now only do autographs by special requests to control the onslaught of my millions of adoring fans, this blog will be 100% authentic Emily Satterfield. On occasion, this will mean I will go on swirling tangents amidst an existential crisis, but it will also include reflections on daily life, how I handle being a hot mess, my adventures to far away lands, and maybe even some recipes if I am feeling inspired. The first few posts I write will be based on prompts that were provided in an application to be an MIT blogger. If, by chance, the person who is evaluating that application is reading this right now, you look lovely today:) Just kidding. But in all seriousness, I truly do want to tell my story on the MIT admissions blog too, so hopefully that works out. </p>
            <p>I wanted to come up with a more clever way to write my first ever blog post - perhaps a pun in the title, or a fun little anecdote - but if I’m telling the truth I have been sitting in my cubicle for about 4 hours now, and the tan walls and silence didn’t really bring me any inspiration. A picture of my new puppy will have to suffice.

	    <h3> What Happened Tuesday?</h3>
	    <h5>July 17th, 2018</h5>
	    <div id = "card"> 
	        <p>Though it’s summer and one might expect my summer Tuesdays to be a thrilling adventure, my Tuesday started out like most of the rest of my days. This is not to say there isn’t meaning to be found in a routine - I guess you just need to pay a little more attention and look a little deeper. I’m going to stop there though, because any good allegory needs a little bit of plot first. I’m not gonna give away this particular Tuesday’s meaning just yet!</p>
             <p>Anyway, onto the story. I work a full time job at Analog Devices as the quality intern. While I do like to joke with myself that the title is fitting for such a high quality intern, my title really means that I work in the failure analysis lab. It’s super cool getting to work with super expensive tools! We evaluate parts on the nano-level! To be perfectly honest, that scale still doesn’t quite register with me, but hair is 20 to 180 microns, so it’s much smaller than that. (which is mind-boggling) With that said, the job of an intern has it’s boring points. In fact, there’s been very little work in Failure Analysis in general lately. Yay Analog Devices? So to fill time, I fiddled with the lab’s 3D printer for a while, which is always a good time. I guess I’m the only one who knows how to use it, so even simple printed boxes bring excitement to the lab. That excitement makes me feel pretty cool. It’s the little things, I swear :)</p>
             <p>After that, I spent a bunch of time at my cubicle. In fact, I finished building the site that I’m writing on right now! You are probably questioning the ethics in doing personal work at work, and believe me I did too, but the lab is just that dead. I ASKED for work to do, and they had nothing to give me. </p>
            <p>Sitting in a cubicle alone for several hours at a time may not seem exciting, and there are times when it’s not, but it also forces you to do all the things you’ve been avoiding. I FINALLY finished the modules for campus safety. Word of advice: don’t do it in one sitting. (well one of the modules was actually kinda fun, but still)</p>
            <p>When 5 rolled around, I packed my bag and my twin picked me up. Unfortunately, it was raining pretty hard, so it was a wet event. Also, my car is kind of a rust-mobile, and it doesn’t mix well with rain - a story for another time. When I got home, I ate a snack and got ready to go to the gym with my mom and sister. </p>
            <p>The gym is where all the meaning comes into this story. First of all, I will give the disclaimer that I am by no means a very talented athlete, I just like going with my sisters and mom to offset all the seven-layer dip I like to eat afterwards. Everyday my gym has different classes, on Tuesdays they have Zumba and Aerobics. Zumba was a disaster last week, so we went for Aerobics today. My sister and I were by far the youngest people in the room. For whatever reason, I thought that this meant that the class would be much easier. I was very wrong - those ladies know how to move! Wow. My noodle arms were no comparison to theirs. </p>
            <p>Until tonight, I have always had some kind of fear of getting old. Not being able to do things anymore, or worse, not wanting to. When I was in the aerobics room with those older ladies and I watched them jamming out to 80s pump up music as we worked out, I realized that  age means nothing. One woman in particular was physically unable to do some of the moves, but when we were doing those sets, she marched in place with her weights like no other. It was not only inspiring, but heartwarming. She had some moves! </p>
            <p>After my experience at the gym, I went home, walked my dogs, and had dinner with my mom and sisters. Then I finished a book I started this weekend. I can’t say I was a huge fan of the ending, but it was an okay read nonetheless. And now here I am now!</p> 
            <p>My schedule forces me to live a fairly routine life during the week. I like to look for the little things that make each day different. This particular Tuesday, it was the little old lady dancing to Michael Jackson. I saw that woman truly happy... and rocking it.

	    <h3> What is your current obsession?</h3>
	    <h5>July 17th, 2018</h5>
	    <div id = "card"> 
            
            <p>I feel like for some people, this question could be taken in very strange directions, but perhaps my love of the TLC show “My Crazy Obsession” is biasing that opinion. Scratch that, it definitely is. Well folks, unfortunately latest obsession will probably not warrant a call from TLC. I’m okay with that. If anything, my latest obsession might just warrant a call from a senior center. I’m also okay with that - old people are awesome and we would have a great time obsessively crafting together. Okay so there it is. I LIKE TO EMBROIDER AND SEW AND I’M PROUD!!! </p>
            <p>You might be asking yourself, “that’s kind of random, how did this obsession all start??” And you’re correct, it is random, but a few episodes of thrifted transformations on youtube made me fall down this rabbit hole. Click on the link if you want, but be warned, side effects include but are not limited to: a sudden need to go to Savers, cravings for crafts, Pintrest-ing, trips to Joann’s fabric for “inspiration”, and embroidering until 2am. So here I am, typing a blog, but subconsciously thinking about sewing. </p>
            <p>Since this obsession began a few weeks ago, I have made a number of alterations to clothes I bought at local thrift stores. At this point, I go into Savers, not with looking for things I actually need, but the opposite. Just the other day, I bought a denim dress that was 18 sizes too big. Can I fully justify doing that? Ehhhh. But it inspired me, and inspiration needs to be taken and put into action. Never let inspiration go to waste! A few days later I made it into this top:</p>
            <img src = “images/blog/thrift1.PNG”/>
            <p>Try to justify NOT staying up to 2 to finish it.</p>
            Here are some of my other transformations: 
            <img src = “images/blog/thrift2.PNG”/>
            This was a really long red leather skirt that I altered.
            <img src = “images/blog/thrift3.PNG”/>
            And here are some jeans that I embroidered.
            <p>I couldn’t really tell you if this is a hobby that is around to stay, but either way, no matter how elderly you might feel, obsess over what makes you happy. </p>
